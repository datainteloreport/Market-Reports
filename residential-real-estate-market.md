Residential Housing Segments Market Forecast 2032

The Residential Real Estate Market is undergoing a transformative phase driven by rapid urbanization, shifting demographics, and evolving consumer preferences. As economies recover from pandemic-induced slowdowns, increased disposable income and low-interest-rate environments are steering growth in residential property investments across global markets.
