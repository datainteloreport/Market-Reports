A significant market driver includes the rising incidence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorders, and related mental health conditions. In addition, urban stressors, lifestyle changes, and growing societal pressures have led to a substantial uptick in psychiatric consultations, thereby boosting prescription volumes of Alprazolam worldwide.
Another key factor accelerating market growth is increased healthcare expenditure in emerging economies. Countries in Asia-Pacific and Latin America are investing heavily in mental health infrastructure and medication accessibility, enabling a broader population base to benefit from pharmaceutical interventions like Alprazolam.
On the flip side, market expansion faces hurdles such as growing concerns about dependency, misuse, and regulatory scrutiny. Governments and healthcare institutions are becoming more cautious about prescribing benzodiazepines due to potential abuse risks, which may limit market growth in some regions.
